## Features

### Existing Features

Î¤he game simulates a conversation between a windsurfer and a digital companion named Wave Rider. 
Here are the existing features:

* Welcome message and user input:
    * The program welcomes the user and asks for their name and location.
    * It validates the user's input to ensure it consists only of letters (for name) and separates city and country with a comma (for location).

* Skill level determination:
    * The program asks the user about their windsurfing skill level on a scale of 1 to 10.
    * Based on the user's input, it categorizes them as a "Chill Surfer," "Freestyle Flyer," "Wave Slayer," or "Legendary Windsurfer."
    * It also suggests windsurfing styles (cruising, freestyle maneuvers, catching waves) suitable for their skill level.

* Weather data retrieval:
    * The program uses an API key to fetch weather data (weather type, temperature, wind speed) for the user's location from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)

* Suitability assessment:
    * The program asks the user about their water temperature preference and air temperature tolerance.
    * It compares the user's preferences with the retrieved weather data to determine if the conditions are suitable for windsurfing.

* Summary and recommendations:
    * The program summarizes the user's preferences, windsurfing skill level, and weather data.
    * It provides recommendations on windsurfing styles (based on skill level) and suggests if a wetsuit might be necessary (based on air temperature).

* Ending message:
    * The program concludes the interaction with a goodbye message and encourages the user to enjoy their windsurfing experience.


### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

* Add gear recommendations:
Based on the user's skill level, windsurfing style (chosen or suggested), weather conditions, and water temperature preferences, the program could recommend specific windsurfing gear (board size, sail size, wetsuit type) to optimize their experience.

* Add spot recommendation:
Based on the user's skill level, windsurfing style preference and weather data, the program could recommend nearby windsurfing spots. This could involve e.g. integrating with a database of windsurfing locations.

* Interactive tutorial selection:
Depending on the user's chosen windsurfing style (cruising, freestyle maneuvers, catching waves), provide short interactive tutorials with text, animations, or even links to video demonstrations. This would help beginners improve their technique or allow experienced surfers to learn new tricks.


### Defensive Programming

This program incorporates several defensive programming features to improve its robustness and handle unexpected user input. For more extended description, go to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) in the Full Testing section.
Here are some key examples:

`1. Input Validation`
Ensures user input conforms to expected format.
Some examples:

* Name validation, welcome_user():
  * Accepts only alphabetical characters(.isalpha()) 
  * Provides informative error messages using ValueError exceptions

* Location validation, welcome_user(): 
  * Uses API to confirm valid city (requests.get)
  * Checks if the user entered both city and country separated by a comma using if "," not in location
  * Validates the number of commas to prevent extra entries
  * Uses a try-except block to catch potential errors and provide informative messages to the user
  * Attempts to split the location string by comma to extract city and country

* Windsurfing Skill Level Validation, windsurfing_skill():   
  * Converts the entered skill level to an integer using int(input())
  * Assigns skill levels ("Chill Surfer", "Freestyle Flyer", "Wave Slayer", "Legendary Windsurfer") based on the numerical input using a series of if-elif statements
  * Handles invalid numerical input by providing an informative message


`2. Error handling`
Handles potential errors during program execution.
Some examples:

* API Request Handling, get_weather_data():
  * Uses a try-except block to catch potential errors during the API request.
  * Checks the API response code (response['cod']) to identify successful requests (code 200) and handles unsuccessful requests by printing an error message.
* The code uses try-except blocks in various functions to catch potential errors during user input, API calls, and data manipulation. It provides informative error messages to the user and avoids program crashes.


`3. Data filtering`
Ensures data types are as expected to prevent unexpected behavior.
Some examples:

* Weather Data Extraction, get_weather_data():
  * Extracts only relevant weather information (weather, temperature, feels_like, wind_speed) from the API response assuming successful request.
  * The windsurfing_skill function uses conditional statements to categorize the user's skill level based on the numerical input and creates a list of windsurfing styles based on the category. This ensures proper handling of the skill level throughout the program.
  * The is_suitable_wind_speed function uses different messages depending on the skill level and wind speed. It also includes a default case to handle unexpected skill level values.


`4. Feedback mechanisms`
Throughout the program, different functions provide informative messages to the user, explaining what the program is doing, what input is expected, and offering guidance.
Some examples:

* Clarification Prompts:
  * In the welcome_user() function, if the user enters a location that doesn't include a comma, the program prompts them again with an explanation of the expected format ("City, Country").

* Error Messages with Guidance:
  * When the program encounters an error fetching weather data for the user's location, it doesn't just display a generic error message. Instead, it informs the user that the location might be misspelled and suggests they try again.


`5.	Modular design`
The code is organized into functions, each responsible for a specific task. This modular design enhances readability, maintainability, and allows for easier troubleshooting.
For more thorough description of the functions, see Full Testing section in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)


`6.	General robust logic`
The program employs robust logic to handle diverse scenarios.

* API interaction
* Flexible input handling
* Adaptive recommendations
* Error Reporting and Logging
* Modular and Testable Code

## Credits

### Code Used

* The idea for the project came from my partner, who is a windsurfing enthusiast. The code was solely initiated in my brain!
* I got help from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23623288/print-full-ascii-art) as the ascii art was not showing without the r in the beginning.
* I looked at this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jBeFdqnNAU&ab_channel=TechNotebook) to understand how I get an API key and where in the code I should enter the API endpoint URL in order to validate the data I wanted to fetch.

### Content & Media

* All the text content was written by myself. 
* I got help from [chatgpt](chat.openai.com/) to generate funnier comments than the ones I'd initially written myself.
* I used this [ascii art](https://www.asciiart.eu/sports-and-outdoors/surfing) for the end of the game.
