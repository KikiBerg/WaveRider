## AUTOMATED TESTING

#### PEP8 CI Validator

[PEP8 CI Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) was used to validate my run.py file.

File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [PEP8 CI Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com)| ![screenshot](documentation/wr_validation_ci.png) | Passed. No warnings or errors |

#### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
I tested only for Desktop results.

`Deployed Site`

| Site | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[WaveRider](https://wave-rider-fd4d233c3f5b.herokuapp.com/) | ![screenshot](documentation/wr_validation_lighthouse.png) | Some minor warnings that I ignored. |

#### Responsiveness

I have not tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.
The template is given by CI so I cannot really control the responsiveness.

- - -

#### Browser Compatibility

I have tested my deployed project on two different browsers to check for compatibility issues. I could not find any issues.
